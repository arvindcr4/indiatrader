# Adam Mancini Trading Strategy Recommendations

## Optimal Parameters

After running backtests with different opening range settings, we've identified the following recommendations:

| Parameter | Optimal Value | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Opening Range | 6 minutes | Best balance of signal quality and quantity |
| Take Profit | R1 pivot level | Exit when price reaches next resistance |
| Stop Loss | Just below pivot | Exit when price falls below main pivot |

## Key Findings

1. **Opening Range Impact**:
   - 3-minute opening range: Generates many signals (15 long, 2 short) but with lower quality
   - 6-minute opening range: Generates fewer signals (3 long, 1 short) but with higher quality (100% win rate)
   - 9+ minute opening range: Too wide to generate signals in our limited test dataset

2. **Trading Frequency**:
   - The 3-minute opening range resulted in 5 trades over a 7-day period
   - The 6-minute opening range resulted in 3 trades over the same period
   - Longer opening ranges resulted in no trades

3. **Win Rate**:
   - The 6-minute opening range showed a 100% win rate on the limited dataset
   - The 3-minute opening range showed a 50% win rate

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Opening Range Configuration**:
   - Use a 6-minute opening range for standard market conditions
   - Consider a 3-minute opening range for higher volatility days
   - Avoid opening ranges longer than 9 minutes as they may be too wide

2. **Risk Management**:
   - Set take-profit levels at key pivot points (R1, R2, R3)
   - Use the pivot level as a stop-loss reference
   - Implement position sizing based on risk percentage (0.5-1% per trade)

3. **Time-Based Rules**:
   - Only take signals in the first 2 hours of trading
   - Avoid signals near market close
   - Be cautious around major economic announcements

4. **Integration with Broker APIs**:
   - Use the implemented ICICI Breeze and Dhan clients for execution
   - Set up automated monitoring for signal generation
   - Implement proper order types (limit orders for entries, stop orders for exits)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Extended Backtesting**:
   - Collect more intraday data (at least 6 months of 5-minute data)
   - Run comprehensive backtests with the optimal parameters
   - Test the strategy on different market conditions

2. **Paper Trading Phase**:
   - Run the strategy in paper trading mode for 2-4 weeks
   - Track performance and make adjustments as needed
   - Compare actual results with backtest predictions

3. **Production Implementation**:
   - Start with small position sizes (25-50% of target allocation)
   - Gradually increase position sizes as the strategy proves consistent
   - Implement proper monitoring and alerts for system health

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regularly review and adjust parameters
   - Monitor for changes in market behavior
   - Implement machine learning for adaptive parameter adjustments

## Conclusion

The Adam Mancini trading strategy shows promise for intraday trading on the NIFTY index. The optimal configuration based on our limited testing is a 6-minute opening range, which balances signal generation with quality. Further testing with a larger dataset is recommended before live trading.
