# IndiaTrader: AI-Driven Intraday Trading Platform

A comprehensive platform for AI-driven intraday trading on the Indian stock market, based on cutting-edge quant techniques and modern ML approaches.

## Project Overview

This repository implements a complete trading pipeline, from data ingestion to signal generation and backtesting:

1. **Live Data Integration** - NSE/BSE market data, news events, and alternative data sources
2. **Feature Engineering** - Technical, order-flow, and NLP-based features
3. **Signal Generation** - Ensemble of Transformers, RL, and Generative models
4. **Backtesting** - Walk-forward testing with realistic transaction costs
5. **Deployment** - Low-latency inference with GPU acceleration

└── deployment/        # Deployment infrastructure
```

## Data Sources

The platform integrates multiple data streams:

| Data Type | Sources | Features |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Market Data | NSE, BSE, MCX | Tick data, Level II order book, options chain |
| News & Events | Money Control, Economic Times | NLP sentiment, event classification |
| Alternative Data | Social media, GitHub, weather | Retail sentiment, sector-specific indicators |

## Signal Generation

The platform employs a hybrid approach with multiple model types:

1. **Sequence Transformers (PatchTST)** - For capturing market patterns across timeframes
2. **Deep RL with xLSTM + PPO** - For optimizing trade execution and position management
3. **Generative Models** - For stress testing and anomaly detection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- API access to Indian market data providers

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indiatrader.git
cd indiatrader

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Configure data sources in `config.yaml`
2. Run data ingestion: `python -m indiatrader.data.ingest`
3. Train models: `python -m indiatrader.models.train`
4. Backtest strategy: `python -m indiatrader.backtesting.run`
5. Deploy for live trading: `python -m indiatrader.deployment.serve`
